# InstagramGenerator
This software is based on LangGraph and it helps Content Creators to automate part of their job. Why? Because, it is an AI app that generates content of whatever topic you want based on your requirements.

### What should you input?
- Provide to the app, the desired language you want the post to be written.
- Define the media type you want for your post: Carrousel, Photo or maybe Video.
- Explain the topic you want to cover in this content.
- Target Audience is a key aspect: Explain who is your expected public.
- Briefly explain what is your instagram account about. This will give the enough context to the app to develop the entire content.

### Explanation
The app collects your input and begins generating a draft of the content. Then, a reflection agent reviews the draft and provides feedback for refinement. This iterative process continues until the content meets approval. If needed, the content is translated into the specified target language. The final output includes everything you need: the post's text, copy descriptions, and the suggested structure for Carousels, Photos, or Videos.
